## 1. Core Technical Justification

The strategy is built on **Bayesian Optimisation (BO)** with a **Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate
and Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function**, configured for a maximisation objective.
This combination is the canonical approach for sample-efficient black-box optimisation of
expensive, gradient-free functions — precisely the capstone setting where each query has a
fixed cost and no analytical gradient is available.

The foundational justification derives from **Jones et al. (1998)** *"Efficient Global
Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions"* (Journal of Global Optimization, 13, 455–492),
which introduced the **EGO algorithm** — the direct predecessor of the GP-EI pipeline
implemented here. EGO demonstrated that a GP posterior provides both a predictive mean
(exploitation signal) and a predictive variance (exploration signal), and that EI naturally
balances these without requiring manual tuning of a separate exploration coefficient.

The choice of the **Matérn-5/2 kernel** over the standard squared-exponential (RBF) kernel is
justified by **Stein (1999)** and later operationalised by **Rasmussen & Williams (2006)**:
Matérn-5/2 assumes twice-differentiable functions — a weaker and empirically more robust
smoothness assumption than the infinitely differentiable RBF, which over-smooths irregular
surfaces and can mislead the posterior in low-data regimes. With 7–8 observations per
function through Round 8, this distinction remains material.

**Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)** — a separate length-scale θⱼ per input
dimension — is justified by **Neal (1996)** and is particularly critical for higher-dimensional
functions (f7: 6D, f8: 8D) where active and inactive dimensions must be distinguished
automatically from data.

**Most directly applied ideas:**

- **EI for maximisation** (Jones et al., Brochu et al.): `EI(x) = (μ(x) − y* − ξ)·Φ(Z) + σ(x)·φ(Z)` where `y* = max(y_observed)` — sign convention confirmed explicitly from Round 5 onward.
- **Multi-start L-BFGS-B with warm-start** (Snoek et al., upgraded W19): top-35 of 5,000 random EI evaluations seed L-BFGS-B, replacing pure random starts. This concentrates gradient descent in the high-EI region — critical in late exploitation rounds where the acquisition landscape is sharply concentrated near the current best.
- **ConstantKernel amplitude decoupling** (W19 addition): separates signal scale from Matérn length-scales, restoring hyperparameter identifiability in tight exploit clusters (Δ‖x‖ < 0.02).
- **Log-space GP for f1** (candidate — not yet applied): outputs spanning ~270 orders of magnitude violate GP stationarity. R6's negative value (−5.32e-7) and R7's near-zero best (1.31e-7) confirm the signal-to-noise ratio is too low for the GP to provide meaningful guidance.
- **HEBO design principles** (Cowen-Rivers et al.): WhiteKernel noise floor, ARD length-scale regularisation, and per-function exploit/explore blending — all operationalised in `build_kernel()` and `optimise_acquisition()` (see §4).

## 3. Third-Party Libraries

| Library | Version | Role | Justification vs alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scikit-learn` | ≥1.3 | `GaussianProcessRegressor`, `ConstantKernel`, `Matern`, `WhiteKernel`, `StandardScaler` | Production-grade GP with ARD support, marginal likelihood optimisation, and stable API. `ConstantKernel` added in W19 to decouple amplitude. GPyTorch offers deep kernels but requires GPU infrastructure not available here. GPflow adds unnecessary dependency weight for 8-function, 7-point datasets. |
| `scipy` | ≥1.11 | `minimize` (L-BFGS-B, `maxiter=500, ftol=1e-12`), `norm` (EI computation) | Standard choice for constrained EI maximisation (Snoek et al., 2012). W19 adds tighter convergence tolerance (`ftol=1e-12`) to improve acquisition precision in late-exploitation rounds. |
| `numpy` | ≥1.24 | Array operations, `np.maximum.accumulate` for best-so-far tracking, warm-start candidate generation | Foundational. `np.random.seed(42)` ensures reproducibility across the full 5,000-candidate warm-start and 35-restart optimisation pipeline. |
| `matplotlib` | ≥3.7 | GP posterior visualisation (convergence trajectories, posterior diagnostics, R8 query comparison) | Chosen over Plotly/Seaborn for static reproducible figures in a Jupyter/GitHub context. |

**Design choice: no dedicated BO library (BoTorch, Ax, Optuna)**  
Deliberate. Using `scikit-learn` primitives directly exposes the full GP-EI pipeline — kernel
construction, marginal likelihood optimisation, EI evaluation, multi-start maximisation — making
every architectural decision explicit and auditable. A black-box BO library would obscure the
choices that are the learning objective of this capstone.

## 4. HEBO Connection — W18/W19 Module Alignment

Rounds 7–8 explicitly map the BBO pipeline to HEBO design principles, establishing the bridge
between this capstone and the W18/W19 hyperparameter tuning modules:

| HEBO Component | This Project Analogue | Implementation | W19 Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matérn-5/2 ARD kernel | Per-dimension length-scale | `Matern(nu=2.5, length_scale=np.ones(d))` | Retained |
| ConstantKernel amplitude | Explicit signal scale | `ConstantKernel(1.0, (1e-3, 1e3))` | **Added W19** |
| WhiteKernel noise floor | Numerical stability | `noise_level_bounds=(1e-8, 1e-1)` | Bounds updated W19 |
| Maximisation EI (ξ=0.01) | `expected_improvement()` | `y_best = np.max(y)` — corrected from R4 | Confirmed |
| Multi-restart L-BFGS-B | `optimise_acquisition()` | 35 starts, `maxiter=500`, `ftol=1e-12` | **Warm-start upgraded W19** |
| MACE Pareto ensemble (implicit) | Per-function strategy blend | EI + directional + hold (per-function) | R8 applied |
| Input warping | Not applied | — | Candidate for f1 if further rounds |

**SALOV Industrial Mapping (R8 Reflection):**  
The 8-function portfolio continues to mirror multi-KPI OEE optimisation on the 12,000 bph PET bottling line, with sharper convergence diagnostics available at Round 8:

- **f5** (global max confirmed, 3-round plateau) ↔ a process parameter already operating at its physical optimum — further trials consume budget with zero expected gain, analogous to running trials on a bottling parameter confirmed at its engineering limit.
- **f4** (R7 regression after R6 peak) ↔ fill-volume overshoot: crossing the optimal setpoint triggers a non-conformance cascade. The R3→R6 improvement followed by R7 regression is precisely the OEE signature of overtuning a closed-loop controller.
- **f3, f7** (monotone directional improvement, Δ≈0.018 and Δ≈0.012 per round) ↔ active PID loop tuning: a stable, decelerating improvement trajectory is the expected response when nudging a tuning parameter toward its optimum under process inertia.
- **f1** (near-zero everywhere) ↔ a conveyor timing parameter operating in a dead band: the signal is so weak that measurement noise dominates, and additional trials without a structural change to the experiment design (e.g., wider exploration or log-scale analysis) yield no actionable gradient.
- **f8** (x3 as the sole active gradient) ↔ a high-dimensional process where only one parameter drives the KPI — analogous to identifying that only the sealing temperature (x3) affects seal integrity across the 8-parameter bottling configuration.

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **BoTorch** (Balandat et al., 2020, NeurIPS) | Benchmark the current pipeline against GPU-accelerated batch-parallel BO — particularly relevant for f8 (8D search space) and as a final-round alternative if further queries are possible. |
| **HEBO** (Cowen-Rivers et al., 2022, JAIR) | Winning NeurIPS 2020 BBO submission; heteroscedastic GP + evolutionary acquisition — directly applicable to f4's bimodal surface. Applied as the W18/W19 module connection in §4. |
| **Nevergrad** (Rapin & Teytaud, 2018, Facebook AI) | Gradient-free benchmark suite; quantitative comparison of GP-EI against CMA-ES and differential evolution on functions with the structural signatures observed (boundary optima for f5, sharp ridges for f7, near-zero surfaces for f1). |
| **BBOB benchmark suite** (Hansen et al., 2009) | Standard 24-function testbed; comparing f1–f8 structural signatures against BBOB classes would allow literature-grounded convergence rate expectations. |

| **Input warping via Kumaraswamy CDF** (Snoek et al., 2014, ICML) | Addresses the f1 near-zero surface: non-linear input transformation improves GP posterior quality when outputs concentrate near machine-precision boundaries. The R7 best of 1.31e-7 confirms the problem persists; this is the most actionable structural improvement available if additional rounds were permitted. |
| **Thompson Sampling for BO** (Chapelle & Li, 2011, NeurIPS) | Alternative acquisition function to EI; draws a GP sample and maximises it, providing natural exploration-exploitation balance without the ξ parameter. Relevant for f2 (sharp, stochastic-appearing landscape) where ξ tuning is difficult. |

## 1. Surrogate model

For each function we model the objective as a draw from a Gaussian Process:

```
f(x) ~ GP( m(x), k(x, x') )
```

with composite kernel

```
k(x, x') = σ² · Matérn_{ν=5/2}( x, x' ; ℓ₁..ℓ_d )  +  σ_n² · δ(x, x')
```

The **Matérn-5/2** kernel gives twice-differentiable sample paths — smoother than Matérn-3/2,
less rigid than the RBF — a good prior for the moderately smooth, occasionally cliff-bearing
responses observed (f4 corners collapse to −27…−31). **ARD** length-scales `ℓ_i` let the GP
learn per-dimension relevance; on f7/f8 several `ℓ_i` railed to the upper bound, i.e. the GP
judged those dimensions flat — the quantitative basis for treating pinned coordinates as
anchors. The **WhiteKernel** `σ_n²` separates observation noise from signal: it collapsed to
the ≈1e-8 floor for the deterministic functions and stayed materially positive only for f2.

Inputs are standardised; targets standardised for conditioning. Hyperparameters are fit by
maximising the log marginal likelihood with 30 L-BFGS-B restarts.

## 2. Acquisition — Expected Improvement (maximisation)

With incumbent best `f*` and posterior `(μ(x), σ(x))`:

```
EI(x) = (μ(x) − f* − ξ) · Φ(z)  +  σ(x) · φ(z),    z = (μ(x) − f* − ξ) / σ(x)
```

We maximise EI (maximisation convention; minimisation functions negated upstream — the
R4→5 correction). For the **terminal** round we set `ξ = 0` (no exploration premium) and
restrict the candidate set to a **trust region** `±0.015` about the incumbent (plus a
`±0.030` halo), reflecting the policy shift to pure exploitation (ε → 0). EI is evaluated on
~3×10⁵ Monte-Carlo candidates and the argmax returned.

## 3. Override doctrine (operative policy)

The GP-EI proposal is a **cross-check**. With 12 points in up to 8 dimensions the posterior
gradient is poorly identified, so a documented empirical signal overrides the surrogate when
stronger. Two Round-13 overrides rest on closed-form geometry:

### 3.1 f1 — ridge + symmetry

All Round-7→12 points satisfy `x₁ + x₂ = 0.978`, and the objective rises monotonically as
`|x₁ − x₂| → 0`:

| x₁+x₂ | \|x₁−x₂\| | y |
|-------|-----------|---|
| 0.978 | 0.028 | 1.31e-7 |
| 0.978 | 0.020 | 2.22e-7 |
| 0.978 | 0.012 | 3.11e-7 |
| 0.978 | 0.008 | 3.45e-7 |

The surrogate's off-ridge drift is unidentified (data lies on a near-1D manifold). The
symmetric ridge point `x₁ = x₂ = 0.489` is the predicted peak → submitted.

### 3.2 f8 — parabolic vertex

With all coordinates but x₃ pinned, the (x₃, y) samples fit a concave parabola:

```
quadratic fit a < 0,  vertex  x₃* = −b / 2a = 0.130000,  ŷ_peak = 9.8596846
```

Deterministic function ⇒ the vertex is the exact argmax → submitted x₃ = 0.130.

## 4. Reinforcement-learning interpretation

- **MAB / exploration–exploitation.** Early rounds = high-ε exploration to locate mass;
  Round 13 = ε → 0 exploitation. `ξ` in EI is the explicit exploration knob, annealed to 0.
- **TD / Q-value updating.** Each realised output is a reward; revising the incumbent best
  is a value update. The *effective learning rate* tracks the inferred noise: α ≈ 1 for
  deterministic functions (one sample is ground truth — f8), low α for f2 (average over
  repeats rather than chase the latest draw). The override doctrine is a manual guard against
  an over-large learning rate — refusing to let one noisy GP signal overwrite a stable
  estimate.
- **Model-based vs model-free.** The GP-EI surrogate is the *model-based* overlay used to
  anticipate outcomes (planning); the realised outputs are the *model-free* signal. Because
  the surrogate is data-starved, model-free experience dominated, with model-based planning
  trusted only on agreement (f4). This is exactly the model-error vulnerability of
  model-based methods under sparse, shifting data — and the AlphaGo-Zero contrast: AGZ pairs
  a learned model with exact-simulator MCTS lookahead; here the "simulator" (GP) is
  approximate and uncertain, so lookahead was a check, not an oracle.

## 5. Numerical notes

`ConvergenceWarning` (L-BFGS-B `ABNORMAL_TERMINATION_IN_LNSRCH`; hyperparameters near
bounds) are expected on flat sparse-data likelihoods and are **warnings, not errors** — the
multi-restart fit returns valid kernels and every function yields a proposal. Suppress for a
clean log via `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=ConvergenceWarning)`; widening the
kernel bounds (`ℓ ∈ [1e-3, 1e4]`, `σ_n² ∈ [1e-12, 1e1]`) removes most at no substantive
cost. Seed pinned at 7; cross-check coordinates are draw-dependent, final strings hard-coded.
